  Problem: Caching code isn't easily reusable any where else in our codebase.
  Solution: Hook in to Mongoose's query generation and execution process.
    - Overiding and add some logics to exec() method in mongoose.Query.prototype.exec
    - Add cache() method to make sure that data is cached at get api.
